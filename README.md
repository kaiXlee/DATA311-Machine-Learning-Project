# DATA311-Machine-Learning-Project
Our project trains on a dataset from Job Search Intervention Study (JOBS II) in 1997. The main focuses were on predicting the post program depression level(depress2), subject's likeliness to participate(comply) and also unsuprivised learning in attempt to find any meaningful relationships between any features.

Below are references to the data description:
